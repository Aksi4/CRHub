          The Ukrainian Carpathians are part of the Eastern Carpathians mountain system in western Ukraine. They are divided into the Outer Eastern Carpathians and the Inner Eastern Carpathians. Their length from the headwaters of the Syan to the headwaters of the Suceava is 280 km and their width is over 110 km. They occupy the territory of Zakarpattia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi regions. The total area of the mountain system is over 21.56 thousand kmÂ². The mountain ranges, separated by longitudinal depressions and delimited by deep transverse valleys, stretch mainly from northwest to southeast. The highest peak is Hoverla (2061 m).
